Question 1: Rotating Meal Menu

Subject: Offer weekly rotating meal menu to subscribers**

Body:

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand that you need assistance with setting up a weekly rotating meal menu for your subscribers. 
Based on your requirements, here’s how you can achieve this using Loop:

1. Subscription Box Options:
   Create two subscription plans: “Box of 6 meals” and “Box of 12 meals.”
 This can be configured in the Loop admin under Subscription Plans.

2. Categorize Meal Catalogue:
   Use product tags to categorize your meals into Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Desserts, and Beverages. 
This will help in organizing and displaying meals as per the desired categories.
 You can refer to the Loop bundle documentation for more details on setting up product tags and collections.

3. Weekly Delivery Only:
   - Configure the subscription frequency to be weekly. 
You can disable the one-time purchase option by setting the product availability exclusively to subscription mode.

4. Promote Meal Diversity:
   To prevent customers from adding multiple quantities of the same product, use the ‘Limit Quantity’ feature in Loop. 
This feature allows you to restrict the quantity of each meal to one per box.

5. Update Menu Weekly:
   Utilize the Loop bulk action feature to update your menu every Friday night.
 This feature allows you to replace products in bulk efficiently. Ensure that new products are added to the respective collections before the update.

6. Replace Products for Existing Subscribers:
   Set up product substitution rules within the Loop app. For instance, you can map Product A to Product X, Product B to Product Y, etc. 
This will automatically replace the products for existing subscribers based on your configured rules.


Best regards,
