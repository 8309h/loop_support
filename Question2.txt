Subject: Billing all week orders on Friday only

Body:

Hi,

Thank you for considering Loop for your subscription management needs.
We can certainly help you configure billing to occur on Fridays for all your customers. 
Here's how you can set this up in Loop:

1. Billing Configuration:
   Navigate to the Loop admin panel and go to the Billing Settings.
   Set the billing frequency to weekly and select Friday as the billing day. 
   This ensures that all subscription orders are billed on Friday each week.

2. Align Subscription Start Dates:
   Ensure that all new subscriptions are aligned with the weekly billing cycle.
   This can be configured during the initial setup or adjusted for existing subscribers to match the Friday billing schedule.

3. Link Selling Plans:
   Go to Loop > Selling Plans and ensure that the selling plans linked to your bundles or subscription products are set to align with the weekly billing cycle.

4. Customer Notifications:
   Configure customer notifications to inform your subscribers about the billing schedule.
   This can help manage customer expectations and improve satisfaction.
